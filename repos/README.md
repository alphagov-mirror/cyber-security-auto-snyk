# repos
Repositories are checked out into this folder organised by GitHub 
organisation and then by team. 

That does mean that some repos currently get checked out more than
once. 

Once the code is checked out snyk is installed and run, the json 
results are saved and then the repos are reset and local clones 
are deleted
